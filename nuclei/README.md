## Prerequisites

This injector uses [ProjectDiscovery Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) to scan assets.

Depending on your deployment method:

- When using the **Docker deployment**, **Nuclei is bundled** within the image.
- When running manually (e.g., in development), **Nuclei must be installed locally** and available in the system's `PATH`.

In both cases, for the injector to operate correctly:

- It **must be able to reach the OpenAEV platform** via the URL you provide (through `OPENAEV_URL` or `config.yml`).
- It **must be able to reach the RabbitMQ broker** used by the OpenAEV platform.

## Configuration variables

Configuration is provided either through environment variables (Docker) or a config
file (`config.yml`, manual).

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

```bash
docker build docker build --build-context common=../common .  -t openaev/injector-nuclei:latest
````

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file with your OpenAEV configuration, then start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> âœ… The Docker image **already contains Nuclei**. No further installation is needed inside the container.

---

### Manual Deployment

#### Prerequisites

* **Nuclei must be installed locally** and accessible via the command line (`nuclei` command).
* You can install it from: [https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei#installation](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei#installation)

#### Configuration

1. Copy `nuclei/config.yml.sample` to `nuclei/config.yml` and edit the relevant values.
2. Install Python dependencies (ideally in a virtual environment):

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the injector:

```bash
cd src
python3 -m nuclei.openaev_nuclei
```

---

## Behavior

The Nuclei injector supports contract-based scans by dynamically constructing and executing Nuclei
commands based on provided tags or templates.

### Supported Contracts

The following scan types are supported via `-tags`:

- Cloud
- Misconfiguration
- Exposure
- Panel
- XSS
- WordPress
- HTTP

The CVE scan uses the `-tags cve` argument and enforces JSON output.

The Template scan accepts a manual template via `-t <template>` or `template_path`.

Additionally, contracts dedicated to scanning for a single, specific CVE may be provisioned in OpenAEV if
two conditions are met:

* A scan for the CVE is supported by a Nuclei template (part of the Nuclei distribution),
* A vulnerability taxonomy entry exists in OpenAEV for that same CVE (under Settings > Taxonomies > Vulnerabilities).

These CVE-specific contracts are set up out of the box to use the Nuclei template (with the `-t` argument)
relevant to the CVE.

### Target Selection

Targets are selected based on the `target_selector` field.

#### If target type is **Assets**:

| Selected Property | Uses Asset Field           |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Seen IP           | endpoint_seen_ip           |
| Local IP          | First IP from endpoint_ips |
| Hostname          | endpoint_hostname          |

#### If target type is **Manual**:

Direct comma-separated values of IPs or hostnames are used.

### Example Execution

A sample command executed by this injector might look like:

```bash
nuclei -u 192.168.1.10 -tags xss
```
Or with a specific template:
```bash
nuclei -u 10.0.0.5 -t cves/2021/CVE-2021-1234.yaml -j
```
### Output Parsing
- The injector captures and parses the JSON output of Nuclei, and returns:

- Confirmed findings (if any) with severity and CVE IDs

- Other lines as unstructured output


### Target Selection

The targets vary based on the provided input type:

#### If target type is **Assets**:

| Targeted Property   | Source Property        |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Seen IP             | Seen IP address        |
| Local IP (first)    | IP Addresses (first)   |
| Hostname            | Hostname               |

#### If target type is **Manual**:

- Hostnames or IP addresses are provided directly as comma-separated values.

### Results

Scan results are categorized into:

- **CVEs** (based on template classifications)
- **Other vulnerabilities** (general issues found)

If no vulnerabilities are detected, the injector will clearly indicate this with a **"Nothing Found"** message.
