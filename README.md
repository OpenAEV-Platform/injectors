The following repository is used to store the OpenAEV injectors for the platform integration with other tools and applications. To know how to enable injectors on OpenAEV, please read the [dedicated documentation](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/injectors).

## Injectors list and statuses

This repository is used to host injectors that are supported by the core development team of OpenAEV. Nevertheless, the community is also developing a lot of injectors, third-parties modules directly linked to OpenAEV. You can find the list of all available injectors and plugins in the [OpenAEV ecosystem dedicated space](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenAEV-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).
