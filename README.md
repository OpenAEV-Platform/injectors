The following repository is used to store the OpenAEV injectors for the platform integration with other tools and applications. To know how to enable injectors on OpenAEV, please read the [dedicated documentation](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/injectors).

## Injectors list and statuses

This repository is used to host injectors that are supported by the core development team of OpenAEV. Nevertheless, the community is also developing a lot of injectors, third-parties modules directly linked to OpenAEV. You can find the list of all available injectors and plugins in the [OpenAEV ecosystem dedicated space](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenAEV-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).

### Creating a new injector

#### Project setup
Assuming a new collector by the name of `new_injector`, create a skeleton directory with:
```shell
poetry new new_injector
```

#### `pyoaev` dependency
We wish to retain the possibility to develop simultaneously on `pyoaev` and collectors. We rely on PEP 508 environment
markers to alternatively install a local path `pyoaev` dependency or a released version from PyPI; specifically the `extra`
marker.

Navigate to the new directory and edit `pyproject.toml`.
```shell
vim new_injector/pyproject.toml
```
(or open the file in your favourite editor).

Here's the expression for the pyoaev dependency, including the `extra` definition:
```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
pyoaev = [
    { markers = "extra == 'prod' and extra != 'dev'", version = "<latest pyoaev release on PyPI>", source = "pypi"  },
    { markers = "extra == 'dev' and extra != 'prod'", path = "../../client-python", develop = true },
]

[tool.poetry.extras]
prod = ["pyoaev"]
dev = ["pyoaev"]
```

### Simultaneous development on pyoaev and an injector
The injectors repository is set to assume that in the event of a simultaneous development work on both `pyoaev`
and injectors, the `pyoaev` repository is cloned in a directory at the same level as the injectors root directory,
and is named strictly `client-python`.

Here's an example layout:
```
.
├── client-python       <= mandatory dir name
│   ├── docs
│   ├── pyoaev
│   ├── scripts
│   └── test
└── injectors          <= this repo root dir
    ├── aws
    ├── http-query
    ├── nmap
    └── nuclei
```


## Contributing

If you want to help use improve or develop new injector, please check out the **[development documentation for new injectors](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/development/injectors)**. If you want to make your injectors available to the community, **please create a Pull Request on this repository**, then we will integrate it to the CI and in the [OpenAEV ecosystem](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenAEV-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).
