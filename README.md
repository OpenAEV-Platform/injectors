The following repository is used to store the OpenBAS injectors for the platform integration with other tools and applications. To know how to enable connectors on OpenBAS, please read the [dedicated documentation](https://docs.openbas.io/latest/deployment/injectors).

## Connectors list and statuses

This repository is used to host connectors that are supported by the core development team of OpenCTI. Nevertheless, the community is also developping a lot of connectors, third-parties modules directly linked to OpenCTI. You can find the list of all available connectors and plugins in the [OpenCTI ecosystem dedicated space](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76).

## Contributing

If you want to help use improve or develop new connector, please check out the **[development documentation for new connectors](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/development/connectors)**. If you want to make your connector available to the community, **please create a Pull Request on this repository**, then we will integrate it to the CI and in the [OpenCTI ecosystem](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76).
